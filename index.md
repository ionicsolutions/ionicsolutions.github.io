## Notes and thoughts on software projects past and present

Like many self-taught developers, I have dabbled with different programming languages throughout my youth.
My journey into more proper software engineering only started in the final year of my Masters, when for my thesis work in experimental Physics I started to write analysis and simulation scripts more frequently and was introduced to microcontrollers and hardware description languages.

Afterwards, during a two-year stint in another Physics research lab, I refactored a large "distributed monolith" into a fairly stable and maintainable microservice architecture.
I also worked on an FPGA-based real-time measurement system and the corresponding toolchain.
At the time, my main focus was on advancing the labs' experiments and hence, I saw software engineering mostly as a means to an end.
In retrospect, however, I learned invaluable lessons.
Most of them the hard way.

Since 2018, when I switched both jobs and fields, I have written software for academic research projects in the AI space, led data science endeavors, and have worked on production systems in "the real world".

On this website, I collect retrospective notes and thoughts on some of the larger software projects I have worked on.
It's by no means an exhaustive portfolio, but provides a glimpse of my growth as a software engineer.

### Retrospective Notes on Projects

- EFrame: Control GUI for a lab experiment with corresponding microservices for the control of individual hardware devices. Lots of refactoring and strange communication protocols. Mostly Python and Qt. Learned to love abstractions, standards and discovered design patterns.
- PyFECS: FPGA-based real-time measurement system with a Python toolchain. Extended an instruction set and in the process unknowingly gained a bunch of insights into processor and compiler design. Refined my understanding of object-oriented programming and thought quite a bit about fast data processing and storage.
- Proprietary client project: Backend engineering in Kotlin for a mobile app. Was introduced to event sourcing, was part of a Scrum team for the first time, and whitnessed first-hand how to (not) develop products and companies.
